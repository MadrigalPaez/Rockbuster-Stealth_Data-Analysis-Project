# Rockbuster Stealth - Data Analysis Project  

## Objetive:  
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company that previously operated physical stores around the world. With the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster plans to leverage its existing movie licenses to launch an **online video rental service**.  

As part of a Data Analytics Program from CareerFoundry, I worked on this project in the role of a *junior data analyst* within Rockbuster’s Business Intelligence (BI) department. The main goal was to load company data into a **relational database management system (RDBMS)**, query it using **SQL**, and provide insights that could support the company’s launch strategy.  


## Key Business Questions:
The Rockbuster Management Board requested data-driven answers to support their 2020 strategy. The main questions include:  
· Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?  
· What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
· In which countries are Rockbuster customers located?  
· Where are customers with the highest lifetime value based?  
· Do sales figures vary across different geographic regions?  


## Tools & Methods: 
· **SQL**: Queried and analyzed data using **PostgreSQL** within **pgAdmin 4**.  
· **Database Management**: PostgreSQL was used as the relational database; **DbVisualizer** supported data exploration and management.  
· **Data Visualization**: **Tableau** was used to present insights in a clear and accessible format.  


## Learning Goals:
This project is part of a Data Analytics course and provided hands-on practice in:  

· Understanding business questions and translating them into SQL queries.  
· Extracting and interpreting data to answer real-world problems.  
· Developing communication skills to present technical results to non-technical stakeholders. 

## Outcomes:
By developing this project, I worked on: 
· Writing and optimizing SQL queries.  
· Performing ad-hoc business analyses.  
· Translating technical results into insights for decision-making.  
· Presenting findings in a concise manner.
