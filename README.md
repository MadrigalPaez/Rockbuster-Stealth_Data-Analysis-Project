# Rockbuster Stealth - Data Analysis Project  

## Introduction  
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company that previously operated physical stores around the world. With the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster plans to leverage its existing movie licenses to launch an **online video rental service**.  

As part of a Data Analytics course, I worked on this project in the role of a *junior data analyst* within Rockbusterâ€™s Business Intelligence (BI) department. The main goal was to load company data into a **relational database management system (RDBMS)**, query it using **SQL**, and provide insights that could support the companyâ€™s launch strategy.  

This project served as a practical exercise to strengthen SQL skills while simulating a real-world business scenario.  


## Key Business Questions  
The Rockbuster Management Board requested data-driven answers to support their 2020 strategy. The main questions include:  

- Which movies contributed the most and least to revenue?  
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?  
- In which countries are Rockbuster customers located?  
- Where are customers with the highest lifetime value based?  
- Do sales figures vary across different geographic regions?  


## Tools & Methods  
- **SQL** â€” Core language used for querying and analyzing data.  
- **RDBMS** â€” To structure and manage Rockbusterâ€™s dataset.  
- **Data Visualization** â€” Used to present insights in a clear and accessible format.  


## Outcomes  
By working on this project, I gained experience in:  

- Writing and optimizing SQL queries.  
- Performing ad-hoc business analyses.  
- Translating technical results into insights for decision-making.  
- Presenting findings in a concise and professional manner.  


## Learning Goals  
This project is part of a Data Analytics course and provided hands-on practice in:  

1. Understanding business questions and translating them into SQL queries.  
2. Extracting and interpreting data to answer real-world problems.  
3. Developing communication skills to present technical results to non-technical stakeholders.
